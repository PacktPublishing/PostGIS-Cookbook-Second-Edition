  Description:
    Abstract:
      This map layer portrays the State and county boundaries of the United 
      States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The map layer was 
      created by extracting county polygon features from the individual 
      1:2,000,000-scale State boundary Digital Line Graph (DLG) files produced 
      by the U.S. Geological Survey.  These files were then merged into a single
      file.  This is a revised version of the November 2004 map layer. 

    Purpose: 
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.  
      No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States 
      in the use of these data.

      Process_Description:
        The 2MILBD data files were originally digitized by the National Mapping
        Division based on the sectional maps contained in 'The National Atlas of 
        the United States of America' published by the USGS in 1970.  The 
        sectional maps were updated during 1978-1981 and digitized in the early 
        1980's.  The data were updated again in the early 1990's by the USGS and 
        published on CD-ROM in 1995 as State DLGs.  Using Arc/INFO software, the 
        updated DLG optional-format files were converted to Arc/INFO coverages 
        using the DLGARC command.  Only county boundaries and attribute 
        information were extracted from the boundaries DLG layer for inclusion 
        in this national coverage.  The county boundary lines that crossed open
        water were excluded for graphic purposes and polygons that represented 
        islands were attributed with the appropriate county information.  The 
        individual State coverages were then merged together using the Arc/INFO
        command MAPJOIN.  "Slivers" created during the MAPJOIN process were 
        identified and deleted using the ELIMINATE command.  In 1998, the 
        delineation of the boundary of Mojave County, AZ was corrected.  Minor 
        modifications were also made to boundaries in Alaska.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The spatial features were compared against the National Atlas 
        hydrography layer (ATLAS-HY9903) and modified where necessary.  
        Incorrect attributes were corrected.  Yellowstone County was deleted and 
        the boundaries for Gallatin and Park Counties were adjusted to absorb 
        the area of Yellowstone National Park.  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin  
        Islands were added.

        Several boundary adjustments were made to counties in Alaska, Nebraska, 
        Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia.  Dade County, Florida was changed to 
        Miami-Dade County and the FIPS code was changed to 12086.

        The county name was corrected for the Grass Cay and Mingo Cay polygons
        in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The State field was changed from names to 
        two-character abbreviations, and a field for State FIPS was added.

      Process_Description: 
        The boundary of Juneau Borough, Alaska was modified to include 
        approximately 61,000 acres of northern Admiralty Island.  Data from 
        the Census Bureau's county boundary file of Alaska was extracted and 
        generalized to a scale of 1:2,000,000.

        The boundary of Denver County, Colorado was modified to include the area 
        occupied by Denver International Airport.  Additional minor corrections 
        were made to Denver County and Adams County.  All corrections were made 
        using data from the Census Bureau's county boundary file of Colorado.

        Finally, county attribution was removed from the Niagara River between 
        Lake Ontario and Lake Erie.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Boundary adjustments were made between the following counties or county 
        equivalents:
        >1) Navajo and Coconino in Arizona
        >2) Tuolumne and Mono in California
        >3) Lake and Chaffee in Colorado
        >4) Gulf and Franklin in Florida

        >18) Lynchburg City and Campbell County in Virginia
        >19) Danville City and Pittsylvania County in Virginia 
        >     
        Numerous additional minor boundary adjustments were made throughout 
        the country.  In Puerto Rico, Florida Municipio was added and an 
        offshore island was added to Ponce Municipio.  A extra polygon within 
        Vega Baja Municipio was merged with the rest of the municipio.

        An attribute containing the area in square miles for the county was
        added.  It was calculated by summing values in the area field for each
        county, which is in square meters, and multiplying the results by 
        0.0000003681.
